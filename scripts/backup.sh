# Prowlarr's or qBittorrent's database; never the Docker socket, and never a path the service's
# org.honeybeartech.hyperion.backup.skip label excludes, such as the downloads directory) and the settings files. The stack is stopped while the archives are written, so the databases are consistent, and
# whatever was running is started again afterwards.
#
#   scripts/backup.sh [DIR]      DIR defaults to backups/<date>-<time> in the checkout (gitignored)
#
# DIR gets one <service>--<path>.tar.gz per mount, the settings (.env and any <service>.env) under env/, a MANIFEST
# naming each archive's service, container path, source and image, and SHA256SUMS, all readable only by the user
# who ran it: the archives hold logins, tokens and private keys. Copy it off the host. Restore with
# scripts/restore.sh. It runs `docker compose` from the checkout, so the standard Compose variables
# (COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, COMPOSE_FILE, COMPOSE_ENV_FILES) select another project, as the smoke test does.
